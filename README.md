## Introduction
MyCryptoTracker aims to give users the ability to keep track of their cryptocurrency purchases without having to build their own spreadsheet and manually update the price of each coin.
The site offers a better user experience than a spreadsheet, allowing the user to simply select a crypto from a dropdown menu, enter in their purchase details into a form and instantly have this data update their portfolio. 
Users can also learn more about cryptocurrencies from the ‘News’ and ‘Rankings’ sections.
